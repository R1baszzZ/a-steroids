## A-steroids 🚀

Welcome to **A-steroids** — my Asteroids-inspired game with a little extra “steroids” in the name because this project is meant to **grow and evolve** over time.

I’m a CS student, still learning the ropes, and this is one of those projects where I learn by building, breaking, fixing, and then building again. If something looks a bit clunky, that’s part of the journey — and honestly, the fun.

### What is it?
It’s a simple space shooter built with **Python** and **Pygame**, inspired by the classic *Asteroids*. Right now it’s small, but the idea is to keep leveling it up as I learn more.

### Why “A-steroids”?
Because this game is on **steroids** — it’s going to get bigger, better, and faster as I keep learning. (Also, I couldn’t resist the pun.)

### Current goals
- Learn game loops, movement, and collision basics
- Keep the code readable while I learn better patterns
- Slowly evolve this into something I’m proud to show off

### Want to help?
Please do! Feel free to:
- Open issues
- Suggest improvements
- Refactor (gently 😅)
- Add features

If you want to change anything, go for it — **PRs and suggestions are welcome**.

Thanks for checking it out. If you’re also learning, you’re not alone. Let’s level up together. ✨

Extending the Project
You've done all the required steps, but if you'd like to make the game your own, here are some ideas:

Add a scoring system
Implement multiple lives and respawning
Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
Add acceleration to the player movement
Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
Add a background image
Create different weapon types
Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
Add a shield power-up
Add a speed power-up
Add bombs that can be dropped
Have fun with it, and make sure to share any improvements that you make with us in the Discord!
