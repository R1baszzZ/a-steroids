## A-steroids 🚀

Welcome to **A-steroids** — my Asteroids-inspired game with a little extra “steroids” in the name because this project is meant to **grow and evolve** over time.

I’m a CS student, still learning the ropes, and this is one of those projects where I learn by building, breaking, fixing, and then building again. If something looks a bit clunky, that’s part of the journey — and honestly, the fun.

### What is it?
It’s a simple space shooter built with **Python** and **Pygame**, inspired by the classic *Asteroids*. Right now it’s small, but the idea is to keep leveling it up as I learn more.

### Why “A-steroids”?
Because this game is on **steroids** — it’s going to get bigger, better, and faster as I keep learning. (Also, I couldn’t resist the pun.)

### Current goals
- Learn game loops, movement, and collision basics
- Keep the code readable while I learn better patterns
- Slowly evolve this into something I’m proud to show off

### Want to help?
Please do! Feel free to:
- Open issues
- Suggest improvements
- Refactor (gently 😅)
- Add features

If you want to change anything, go for it — **PRs and suggestions are welcome**.

Thanks for checking it out. If you’re also learning, you’re not alone. Let’s level up together. ✨
